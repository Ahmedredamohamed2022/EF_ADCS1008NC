# 10-Bit, 80KSPS, SAR ADC Without Controller
## 1. Description
The EF_ADCS1001NC is a low-power, single-channel CMOS 10-bit analogue-to-digital converter with a flexible parallel interface. It has off-chip SAR controller. The converter is based on a successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture with an internal track-and-hold circuit. It can be configured to accept a 2.5 V single-ended input span. The output parallel data is binary and compatible with many common DSP parallel interfaces. The EF_ADCS1001NC operates with a dual power supply; 1.8 V and 3.3 V supply the digital and analogue IP blocks, respectively. Normal power consumption reaches XX mW in idle mode. The functional block diagram is presented in Figure 1.
